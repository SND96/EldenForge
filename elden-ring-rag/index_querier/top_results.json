        "Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is amongst the most popular characters in Elden Ring , and it's easy to see why.\n\nHer lore and backstory are phenomenal, her arena is stunning, and even the region she resides in is filled with constant awe-striking moments.\n\nFurthermore, the boss encounter is incredibly challenging but fair, epic, and gorgeous.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: How To Defeat Maliketh, The Black Blade While it's an optional boss fight on all counts, that won't stop most people from going through the trouble to reach her.\n\nEverything about this encounter is exhilarating, but it's understandable to see many people struggle to best her.\n\nAfter all, this is one of the most demanding fights in the entire game, and we wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella Overview Location Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree Optional Yes Summons Players and Spirit Ashes Drops  Weak\n\nTo  Malenia, Blade of Miquella, resides deep within Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree.\n\nHowever, to get here, you must first reach Miquella's Haligtree, which can take quite some time in its own right.\n\nWhile this encounter is optional, it may be worth your time to seek it out as its one of the more unique battles in the entire game.\n\nAdditionally, the whole area is brimming with excellent items and gear but has callous enemies, so come prepared.\n\nWe recommend trying to tackle Malenia towards to end of the game when you are around Levels 90-100.\n\nShe's pretty challenging to take down.\n\nIf you are successful in besting Malenia in combat, you will earn 480,000 Runes and the Remembrance of the Rot Goddess, which you can exchange for cool rewards with Enia at the Roundtable Hold.\n\nIn addition to that, you will also receive Malenia's Great Rune, which you can activate by taking it to the Isolated Divine Tower.\n\nYou can reach the Isolated Divine Tower via a teleporter on the Divine Bridge or the Tower of Ruin's teleportation chest.\n\nThe thing with Malenia is she actually doesn't possess all that many attacks, but the attacks she does have are crazy good, well mastered, and are daunting to deal with.\n\nThink of her as the final boss in a fighting game.\n\nShe's not meant to have a ton of abilities, just a handful of excellent ones that will light you up if you make the slightest miscalculation or get a bit too careless.\n\nThere are two phases in this battle, and both of them are excruciatingly difficult.\n\nAlthough, the second phase may be a tad more challenging as she can one-shot practically anyone, even those who centered their build around having a large health pool and heavy armor.\n\nShe hits hard and is incredibly agile.\n\nOne wrong move will end you, but it isn't impossible or unfair.\n\nJust take everything one step at a time, and you will prevail.\n\nPhase 1 Waterfowl Dance Malenia leaps into the air then dives at her target.\n\nShe then eloquently twirls around while performing a series of slashes with her blade.\n\nFollowing that, she will let out two more slashes with a dash between each one, then ends it with another spinning AoE attack.\n\nThis attack has multiple hits, with each hit ultimately leading to her target's end.\n\nCounter: Run away from Malenia and keep running to create great distance between you two.\n\nIf you can wield a shield that has an excellent guard boost, you can use it to absorb most of her strikes.\n\nIf all else fails, try rolling towards her if she catches her, this will allow you to have a chance of surviving her onslaught of slashes.\n\nRolling backward or sideways will likely get you caught up in her fury, so we recommend avoiding that at all costs.\n\nKick Combos Most of Malenia's attack prowess comes from just this one move.\n\nMalenia's sweeping kick attack will get swiftly followed up with five possible moves, all of which are devastating to get caught by.\n\nWe will break each of them down below!\n\nCounter: Malenia's kick is easily telegraphed and can be avoided quite effortlessly if you're looking out for it.",
        "Malenia, Blade of Miquella , is the area boss of Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree .\n\nShe is, by most accounts, the most difficult boss in Elden Ring, and quite possibly the most difficult boss in any of the SoulsBorne titles.\n\nHer powerful attacks, unrelenting combos, and unique boss mechanic make her a fearful foe that you should not face until you have defeated all of Elden Ring's other challenges.\n\nCheck out our boss guide to defeating Malenia below: Where to Find Malenia, Blade of Miquella Malenia is the final boss of a secret Legacy Dungeon called Miquella's Haligtree , wherin lies Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree .\n\nThis dungeon can only be accessed in the final northern region known as the Consecrated Snowfield .\n\nTo reach the snowfield region, you need a secret Medallion to use at the Grand Lift of Rold.\n\nThe two halves are given by an Albinauric named Albus that is disguised as a barrel in the Albinauric village in western Liurnia under the large mountain.\n\nThe other half can be found in the Mountaintops of the Giants , on the far northwestern side after clearing the large and imposing Castle Sol .\n\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella Boss Fight Guide  Malenia Blade of Miquella At last we have arrived, the boss of the Haligtree: Malenia, Blade of Miquella , quite possibly FromSoft's most devious invention yet.\n\nMalenia has all the typical trappings of a difficult boss (high damage, oppressive attack pattern, tricky combos), but what truly sets her apart is her unique lifesteal mechanic that gives her health back on every hit, even when you block.\n\nThis means you can't just hide behind your shield and wait for an opening, or else she will steal back every bit of damage you deal.\n\nThis can turn the battle into a long, drawn out war of attrition, but the better approach is to simply damage race her with the most powerful weapon you can find.\n\nWeapons that have long range abilities like Rivers of Blood , Moonveil , and Sword of Night and Flame are all great picks for this fight.\n\nWe also recommend having a 100% physical block shield with Barricade Shield to deal with one of her tricky attacks, and some defensive gear like the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman we got earlier.\n\nUsing an Ash Summon in this fight is very tempting, but keep in mind she can lifesteal off of your summon the same way she can from you.\n\nIf your summon gets caught up in one of her long combos it may do more harm than good.\n\nAsh Mimic is probably your best option.\n\nThe 2v1 attacks will keep her stun locked, maybe even leading to topple.\n\nAnother option is Latenna the Albinauric, who you can place on the edge of the boss arena and let her shoot from far out of attack range.\n\nJust be sure you do NOT let Malenia turn her attention to Latenna or she will absolutely shred her.\n\nReady?\n\nOkay.\n\nTime to fight.\n\nFirst thing to note is that Malenia does not really zip across the battlefield very often.\n\nShe doesn't have any projectile attacks so if you never get close to her she will likely just slow walk towards you until you approach.\n\nYou can use this to your advantage any time you need to heal or rest for a second.  \n\nWhen you do approach it is important to identify which of her attacks are easily punished, so here are some things to look out for: Her basic sword attacks should just be avoided or blocked.\n\nShe will usually execute two to three wide swings in a row, then end with a jumping slam attack or sweeping kick that deals massive stamina damage on shield.\n\nThere is an opportunity to Guard Counter here, but I would advise against it due to the unpredictability or her combos.\n\nWhen you see her long blade slide backwards up her hand she is about to do a short dash followed by a multi-hit combo.\n\nI recommend just blocking the first three hits, then rolling toward her to avoid the fourth.\n\nFrom here she can extend the combo into a jumping slam or a delayed wide swing.",
        "Elden Ring has a lot of tough boss fights, but one of the hardest is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\n\nShe's featured in the opening cut scene of Elden Ring and is also part of the Collector's Edition there's both a statue and a replica of Malenia's helmet.\n\nShe's pretty much as close as Elden Ring gets to a mascot, and as such, she's a powerful symbol of the game's difficulty.\n\nMalenia features a lot of long, sweeping sword attacks that are also lightning-fast and cover a lot of ground.\n\nHer Waterfowl Dance attack, in particular, can close any gap quickly and leave very little room to dodge.\n\nProper timing and sufficient stamina is essential for surviving this attack, or just being far enough away that she can't quite reach.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: Where To Find All Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones Or you can do what Reddit user toxicBird7 and just throw a freezing pot at her whenever she performs the wind-up animation for her attack.\n\nUser toxicBird7 posted a video to the Elden Ring subreddit (via GamesRadar ) showcasing the ease by which you can interrupt Malenia's most powerful attack just by tossing a pot at her face.\n\nJust throw it whenever she leaps into the air in preparation for her Waterfowl Dance move and she'll be stunned right out of it.\n\nThe hardest part of this strategy is just gathering the materials to make freezing pots.\n\nFirst, you need Glintstone Craftsman's Cookbook 6 for the recipe, and then you need both ritual pots and rimed crystal buds to craft freezing pots.\n\nGetting rimed crystal buds will require you travel southwest of the Inner Consecrated Snowfield grace location and then run around the base of the frozen pillars.\n\nOnce you have a few pots, you're ready for Malenia, but a word of caution.\n\nAll bosses have escalating status resistance, so you'll only be able to throw two freezing pots at Malenia before she develops a tolerance to them.\n\nAfter that, it'll require two pots for the same effect.\n\nSadly, two pots require far better timing than just the one, and you might be better off just learning the specific dodge timing.\n\nWe\u2019ve got plenty of other tips to help you get through the Lands Between, so check out our Elden Ring guide here .\n\nNext: There's No Better Video Game Protagonist Than Ben From Full Throttle"
