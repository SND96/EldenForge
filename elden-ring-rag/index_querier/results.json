        "Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is amongst the most popular characters in Elden Ring , and it's easy to see why.\n\nHer lore and backstory are phenomenal, her arena is stunning, and even the region she resides in is filled with constant awe-striking moments.\n\nFurthermore, the boss encounter is incredibly challenging but fair, epic, and gorgeous.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: How To Defeat Maliketh, The Black Blade While it's an optional boss fight on all counts, that won't stop most people from going through the trouble to reach her.\n\nEverything about this encounter is exhilarating, but it's understandable to see many people struggle to best her.\n\nAfter all, this is one of the most demanding fights in the entire game, and we wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella Overview Location Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree Optional Yes Summons Players and Spirit Ashes Drops  Weak\n\nTo  Malenia, Blade of Miquella, resides deep within Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree.\n\nHowever, to get here, you must first reach Miquella's Haligtree, which can take quite some time in its own right.\n\nWhile this encounter is optional, it may be worth your time to seek it out as its one of the more unique battles in the entire game.\n\nAdditionally, the whole area is brimming with excellent items and gear but has callous enemies, so come prepared.\n\nWe recommend trying to tackle Malenia towards to end of the game when you are around Levels 90-100.\n\nShe's pretty challenging to take down.\n\nIf you are successful in besting Malenia in combat, you will earn 480,000 Runes and the Remembrance of the Rot Goddess, which you can exchange for cool rewards with Enia at the Roundtable Hold.\n\nIn addition to that, you will also receive Malenia's Great Rune, which you can activate by taking it to the Isolated Divine Tower.\n\nYou can reach the Isolated Divine Tower via a teleporter on the Divine Bridge or the Tower of Ruin's teleportation chest.\n\nThe thing with Malenia is she actually doesn't possess all that many attacks, but the attacks she does have are crazy good, well mastered, and are daunting to deal with.\n\nThink of her as the final boss in a fighting game.\n\nShe's not meant to have a ton of abilities, just a handful of excellent ones that will light you up if you make the slightest miscalculation or get a bit too careless.\n\nThere are two phases in this battle, and both of them are excruciatingly difficult.\n\nAlthough, the second phase may be a tad more challenging as she can one-shot practically anyone, even those who centered their build around having a large health pool and heavy armor.\n\nShe hits hard and is incredibly agile.\n\nOne wrong move will end you, but it isn't impossible or unfair.\n\nJust take everything one step at a time, and you will prevail.\n\nPhase 1 Waterfowl Dance Malenia leaps into the air then dives at her target.\n\nShe then eloquently twirls around while performing a series of slashes with her blade.\n\nFollowing that, she will let out two more slashes with a dash between each one, then ends it with another spinning AoE attack.\n\nThis attack has multiple hits, with each hit ultimately leading to her target's end.\n\nCounter: Run away from Malenia and keep running to create great distance between you two.\n\nIf you can wield a shield that has an excellent guard boost, you can use it to absorb most of her strikes.\n\nIf all else fails, try rolling towards her if she catches her, this will allow you to have a chance of surviving her onslaught of slashes.\n\nRolling backward or sideways will likely get you caught up in her fury, so we recommend avoiding that at all costs.\n\nKick Combos Most of Malenia's attack prowess comes from just this one move.\n\nMalenia's sweeping kick attack will get swiftly followed up with five possible moves, all of which are devastating to get caught by.\n\nWe will break each of them down below!\n\nCounter: Malenia's kick is easily telegraphed and can be avoided quite effortlessly if you're looking out for it.",
        "Malenia, Blade of Miquella , is the area boss of Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree .\n\nShe is, by most accounts, the most difficult boss in Elden Ring, and quite possibly the most difficult boss in any of the SoulsBorne titles.\n\nHer powerful attacks, unrelenting combos, and unique boss mechanic make her a fearful foe that you should not face until you have defeated all of Elden Ring's other challenges.\n\nCheck out our boss guide to defeating Malenia below: Where to Find Malenia, Blade of Miquella Malenia is the final boss of a secret Legacy Dungeon called Miquella's Haligtree , wherin lies Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree .\n\nThis dungeon can only be accessed in the final northern region known as the Consecrated Snowfield .\n\nTo reach the snowfield region, you need a secret Medallion to use at the Grand Lift of Rold.\n\nThe two halves are given by an Albinauric named Albus that is disguised as a barrel in the Albinauric village in western Liurnia under the large mountain.\n\nThe other half can be found in the Mountaintops of the Giants , on the far northwestern side after clearing the large and imposing Castle Sol .\n\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella Boss Fight Guide  Malenia Blade of Miquella At last we have arrived, the boss of the Haligtree: Malenia, Blade of Miquella , quite possibly FromSoft's most devious invention yet.\n\nMalenia has all the typical trappings of a difficult boss (high damage, oppressive attack pattern, tricky combos), but what truly sets her apart is her unique lifesteal mechanic that gives her health back on every hit, even when you block.\n\nThis means you can't just hide behind your shield and wait for an opening, or else she will steal back every bit of damage you deal.\n\nThis can turn the battle into a long, drawn out war of attrition, but the better approach is to simply damage race her with the most powerful weapon you can find.\n\nWeapons that have long range abilities like Rivers of Blood , Moonveil , and Sword of Night and Flame are all great picks for this fight.\n\nWe also recommend having a 100% physical block shield with Barricade Shield to deal with one of her tricky attacks, and some defensive gear like the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman we got earlier.\n\nUsing an Ash Summon in this fight is very tempting, but keep in mind she can lifesteal off of your summon the same way she can from you.\n\nIf your summon gets caught up in one of her long combos it may do more harm than good.\n\nAsh Mimic is probably your best option.\n\nThe 2v1 attacks will keep her stun locked, maybe even leading to topple.\n\nAnother option is Latenna the Albinauric, who you can place on the edge of the boss arena and let her shoot from far out of attack range.\n\nJust be sure you do NOT let Malenia turn her attention to Latenna or she will absolutely shred her.\n\nReady?\n\nOkay.\n\nTime to fight.\n\nFirst thing to note is that Malenia does not really zip across the battlefield very often.\n\nShe doesn't have any projectile attacks so if you never get close to her she will likely just slow walk towards you until you approach.\n\nYou can use this to your advantage any time you need to heal or rest for a second.  \n\nWhen you do approach it is important to identify which of her attacks are easily punished, so here are some things to look out for: Her basic sword attacks should just be avoided or blocked.\n\nShe will usually execute two to three wide swings in a row, then end with a jumping slam attack or sweeping kick that deals massive stamina damage on shield.\n\nThere is an opportunity to Guard Counter here, but I would advise against it due to the unpredictability or her combos.\n\nWhen you see her long blade slide backwards up her hand she is about to do a short dash followed by a multi-hit combo.\n\nI recommend just blocking the first three hits, then rolling toward her to avoid the fourth.\n\nFrom here she can extend the combo into a jumping slam or a delayed wide swing.",

        "In the entirety of Elden Ring , no name strikes as much fear into the hearts of players as Malenia the Blade of Miquella.\n\nOften referred to as the hardest boss in the game , the mere thought of fighting this red-headed swordswoman is enough to make even the most hardcore of gamers tremble.\n\nYes, Malenia is truly a terrifying opponent, but only in her home universe of Elden Ring.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: Who Won The Fight Between Radahn And Malenia?\n\nWhile Elden Ring is host to a wide variety of unique and powerful beings , the power-scaling for this universe is severely different compared to other gaming universes.\n\nWhere a boss from Elden Ring may look like an unbeatable opponent in their game, they could be seen as little more than an angry kitten in another.\n\nHere are a few characters from other games that do just that to Malenia.\n\nOne of Malenia's biggest strengths is her speed.\n\nIn her first phase, she overwhelms her enemies with a barrage of blade flourishes all while nimbly dodging whatever attacks you throw at her.\n\nEven in her second phase, her attacks are incredibly difficult to dodge, especially when avoiding the pools of Scarlet Rot she leaves everywhere.\n\nHowever, there's one being who wouldn't be affected by Malenia's speed at all.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog is speed personified.\n\nTo him, Malenia's would be moving at a snail's pace.\n\nHe could easily avoid her all while striking with his own attacks against the Blade of Miquella.\n\nThis isn't even considering his Super Sonic form where he can move faster than light.\n\nThis may seem like an odd choice considering Sans' frailty, but the funny skeleton and Malenia share many similarities.\n\nBoth rely on quick and nearly unavoidable attacks to overwhelm their opponent all while swiftly avoiding attacks themselves.\n\nHowever, the thing that gives Sans an edge in this fight is his versatility.\n\nRelated:\n\nUndertale: Things You Didn't Know About Sans While Malenia relies on her sword, Sans has an entire arsenal of abilities to aid him in combat.\n\nFrom the various bones he can summon from anywhere to his Gaster Blasters, the sheer variety of attacks that Sans is capable of unleashing would be more than enough to overcome Malenia.\n\nOn the off chance that it's not enough, he always has his 'Special Attack'.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a shovel to be a viable weapon against legions of monsters and knights, but Shovel Knight has proven this belief to be invalid.\n\nOn his quest to rescue Shield Knight, Shovel Knight has faced countless enemies with far more diversity and attacks than Malenia.\n\nThrough his travels, he has honed his skills with the shovel and gained numerous items that would make him more than a match for Malenia.\n\nHe can use the War Horn to block Malenia's incoming charges.\n\nHe could deal significant damage from a range with his Chaos Sphere.\n\nHe can even avoid all her attacks with the Phase Locket.\n\nWith all of his abilities, coupled with his shovel, there would be nothing Malenia could do.\n\nThere are very few that can stand up to the One Winged Angel.\n\nCloud Strife is one of them and so is Sora, ironically enough.\n\nHowever, Malenia is definitely not one of the people who could contend with Final Fantasy's most infamous character.\n\nIn a duel of pure swordsmanship, the battle would be fairly close as both are formidable warriors, but Sephiroth is far more than a simple swordsman.\n\nSephiroth has access to world-breaking magic, elemental manipulation, and even a godly transformation that can reduce his enemies fighting capabilities and curse them to die in a given time.\n\nIf these two were to fight, it wouldn't even be close.\n\nThey say the most unsuspecting enemy is the deadliest.\n\nWell, there's nothing more unsuspecting than a teenager wielding an oversized key.\n\nTime and time again, Sora has proven why the keyblade is one of the most feared weapons of his world and why he's one of the strongest keyblade wielders.",
        "From the modder who brought us the legendary Malenia versus Starscourge Radahn comes the next bout in our Elden Ring heavyweight series, Malenia, Blade of Miquella versus Maliketh, the Black Blade.\n\nWhich of these late-game swordmasters will come out on top?\n\nBosses in FromSoftware games are formidable opponents.\n\nThey wreak havoc on playthroughs, speedruns, no damage runs, and often lead to broken controllers.\n\nSo, it's only natural for us to want to sit back and watch them wail on each other instead of us from time to time.\n\nRELATED:\n\nElden Ring And Euphoria Tell The Same Story Malenia versus Radhan was quite the spectacle, but the queen of rot managed to come out on top.\n\nIt's important to note that this isn't the same Radhan she previously fought, as he's now lost most of himself to the disease she inflicted upon Caelid.\n\nMalenia versus Maliketh is an interesting lineup, as she has the power to steal a foe's health, and he has the ability to consistently drain someone's life force.\n\nIt's really a battle of speed to see if Malenia can steal back enough of her health to offset Maliketh's debuff.\n\nAt the start of the first round you'll notice the size difference between the two bosses, with Maliketh towering over Malenia.\n\nThis can work in her favour though, as his large hitbox means her attacks don't have to be quite as accurate.\n\nMaliketh immediately seems to get the upper hand as his devastating attacks and debilitating damage over time effects quickly eat through Malenia's health bar.\n\nShe may feel quick when you fight her yourself, but against Maliketh she seems to move at a snail's pace.\n\nThe beast clergyman is able to land several vicious attacks in a row before she gets the chance to respond.\n\nHer hit points seem to almost completely disappear a few times but she manages to cling on with her lifesteal ability, chipping away at Maliketh as she gets some much-needed dodges in.\n\nShe transforms into the Goddess of Rot to even the odds, but even so, the first round is close.\n\nWatch the video above to see the full fight and all rounds for yourself.\n\nNext: What Does Your Apex Legends Inventory Say About You?"
