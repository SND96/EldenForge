        "Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is amongst the most popular characters in Elden Ring , and it's easy to see why.\n\nHer lore and backstory are phenomenal, her arena is stunning, and even the region she resides in is filled with constant awe-striking moments.\n\nFurthermore, the boss encounter is incredibly challenging but fair, epic, and gorgeous.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: How To Defeat Maliketh, The Black Blade While it's an optional boss fight on all counts, that won't stop most people from going through the trouble to reach her.\n\nEverything about this encounter is exhilarating, but it's understandable to see many people struggle to best her.\n\nAfter all, this is one of the most demanding fights in the entire game, and we wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella Overview Location Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree Optional Yes Summons Players and Spirit Ashes Drops  Weak\n\nTo  Malenia, Blade of Miquella, resides deep within Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree.\n\nHowever, to get here, you must first reach Miquella's Haligtree, which can take quite some time in its own right.\n\nWhile this encounter is optional, it may be worth your time to seek it out as its one of the more unique battles in the entire game.\n\nAdditionally, the whole area is brimming with excellent items and gear but has callous enemies, so come prepared.\n\nWe recommend trying to tackle Malenia towards to end of the game when you are around Levels 90-100.\n\nShe's pretty challenging to take down.\n\nIf you are successful in besting Malenia in combat, you will earn 480,000 Runes and the Remembrance of the Rot Goddess, which you can exchange for cool rewards with Enia at the Roundtable Hold.\n\nIn addition to that, you will also receive Malenia's Great Rune, which you can activate by taking it to the Isolated Divine Tower.\n\nYou can reach the Isolated Divine Tower via a teleporter on the Divine Bridge or the Tower of Ruin's teleportation chest.\n\nThe thing with Malenia is she actually doesn't possess all that many attacks, but the attacks she does have are crazy good, well mastered, and are daunting to deal with.\n\nThink of her as the final boss in a fighting game.\n\nShe's not meant to have a ton of abilities, just a handful of excellent ones that will light you up if you make the slightest miscalculation or get a bit too careless.\n\nThere are two phases in this battle, and both of them are excruciatingly difficult.\n\nAlthough, the second phase may be a tad more challenging as she can one-shot practically anyone, even those who centered their build around having a large health pool and heavy armor.\n\nShe hits hard and is incredibly agile.\n\nOne wrong move will end you, but it isn't impossible or unfair.\n\nJust take everything one step at a time, and you will prevail.\n\nPhase 1 Waterfowl Dance Malenia leaps into the air then dives at her target.\n\nShe then eloquently twirls around while performing a series of slashes with her blade.\n\nFollowing that, she will let out two more slashes with a dash between each one, then ends it with another spinning AoE attack.\n\nThis attack has multiple hits, with each hit ultimately leading to her target's end.\n\nCounter: Run away from Malenia and keep running to create great distance between you two.\n\nIf you can wield a shield that has an excellent guard boost, you can use it to absorb most of her strikes.\n\nIf all else fails, try rolling towards her if she catches her, this will allow you to have a chance of surviving her onslaught of slashes.\n\nRolling backward or sideways will likely get you caught up in her fury, so we recommend avoiding that at all costs.\n\nKick Combos Most of Malenia's attack prowess comes from just this one move.\n\nMalenia's sweeping kick attack will get swiftly followed up with five possible moves, all of which are devastating to get caught by.\n\nWe will break each of them down below!\n\nCounter: Malenia's kick is easily telegraphed and can be avoided quite effortlessly if you're looking out for it.",
        "Just make sure you have enough Mind or FP Flasks to keep up the assault.  \n\nWith enough practice and determination you will become an expert at defeating Malenia.\n\nUnfortunately, this is only the beginning....\n\nMalenia, Goddess of Rot Boss Fight  Yep, of course there is a second phase to this fight.\n\nAs if that first phase wasn't hard enough now we have to face a faster, more aggressive Malenia with stronger attacks.\n\nOh, and of course she can inflict Scarlet Rot as well.\n\nShe will always open the battle with the same attack, an aerial dive that leads into a giant area of effect blast that inflicts Scarlet Rot.\n\nYou have a moment to drink one Flask and put your guard up before she will dive.\n\nAs soon as you see her make her move roll toward her, then run away as fast as you can to avoid the blast.\n\nYou will probably get hit at least once, but that is no issue as long as you aren't too close to the center of the blast.\n\nA giant flower will bloom around her, dealing continuous Rot to anyone who stands too close.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to heal up or eat any damage bonus items you might have, since she won't do any other attacks while the flower is up.\n\nAs soon as the flower begins to fade run in and start attacking.\n\nYou should be able to get three or four hits before she reacts, usually with a spinning kick.\n\nIf you see the kick coming you can roll in and get in another hit or two, but she likes to follow it up with a jump into slam attack, which now leaves a delayed explosion on the ground that will prevent the usual punish.\n\nFrom here things get very messy.\n\nHer combos have changed slightly and she is far more aggressive than she was in phase one.\n\nIt is very easy to simply get caught up on her blender of attacks and die before you even get to play.\n\nBecause of this you aren't likely to get much time to learn the new movements before she kills you.\n\nInstead I recommend a simpler strategy: run away!\n\nMalenia is faster than you, but if you keep running away (while dodging any dashes she might do)\n\nyou can eventually bait her into doing one of the bad attacks listed below.  \n\nThe main ones we want to see are her simple aerial dash attacks.\n\nShe will leap high into the air, hover for a moment, then dash toward you with an easily dodged attack you can punish with two or three back attacks.\n\nHowever, if she points the sword TOWARD you while in the air she is going to land and pivot before immediately executing another grounded dash attack.\n\nThis is easy to dodge as long as you see it coming, and can be punished just as easily as any other dash.  \n\nAnother easy punish is her doppelganger attack.\n\nShe will float high into the air, then send down a flurry of doppelgangers who will attack one by one.\n\nThe doppelgangers will attack about five times (these do not lifesteal, so you can simply block with Barricade) before Malenia herself flies toward you with a thrust attack.\n\nThis attack can be punished similarly to the grounded dash, but you need to be careful because she will occasionally chain this directly into a SECOND dash attack, which can also be easily dodge rolled before punishing.\n\nFinally, she will occasionally repeat blooming flower attack from the start of the battle.\n\nThis is probably the best attack to see because it is incredibly slow and easy to punish, meaning you can take a second to heal, buff up, then hit her with everything you've got.\n\nSimilar to phase one, long ranged weapon abilities like the ones on Moonveil or Sword of Night and Flame are invaluable here.\n\nThey let you punish the attacks I've mentioned above without ever really putting yourself in real danger.\n\nAll you really need is enough patience and luck to burn her down before she catches you with her enhanced Waterfowl Dance or grab attack.",

        "We will break each of them down below!\n\nCounter: Malenia's kick is easily telegraphed and can be avoided quite effortlessly if you're looking out for it.\n\nHowever, we recommend running far away from her when she attempts following her kick up with the Multiple Slashes or the Grab.\n\nThe Dash Slash is telegraphed with a quick flash on the blade, giving you ample time to block or roll out of the way.\n\nPhase 2 Scarlet Aeonia Malenia will jump into the air and dive at the player, creating an enormous flower on the ground around her where she lands.\n\nThe flower will then swiftly explode, spreading Scarlet Rot around it in a large AoE. She will always perform this attack first in the second phase and will do it periodically throughout the encounter.\n\nCounter: When Malenia takes to the sky, run underneath and through her and keep going.\n\nStay far away from her and avoid the Scarlet Rot at all cost.\n\nMalenia will be unable to attack or move temporarily after she lands, so she won't be a threat to you.\n\nDon't risk it, just wait until the attack is over before engaging with her further.\n\nPhantom Summoning Malenia leaps high into the air and sends phantom visions of herself at her target in a straight line, dealing excessive damage.\n\nShe then caps the attack off by diving in with a sweeping attack on her target.\n\nCounter: Create distance and keep dodging to the left and right, don't stay in one position, and never dodge in a straight path.\n\nThis ability tracks you, so it's better to have her visions go off course.\n\nBoth ranged and melee-based builds have their work cut out for them in this encounter as Malenia is relentless and can apply suffocating pressure on her opponents because of it.\n\nIf you hesitate for even a second, Malenia can take advantage of the situation and end you before the fight has really begun.\n\nShe will close any gap in a flash and cut you down in the blink of an eye, but you can overcome this with a solid strategy and lots of patience.\n\nIn the first phase of the encounter, the vast majority of Malenia's attacks are avoidable by rolling to the left or right as she performs them.\n\nIn addition to that, Malenia has incredibly low poise, which means you can interrupt her attacks and stunlock her from time to time.\n\nIf available, use weapons that can cause Bleed buildup, as that will periodically take large chunks of her health away.\n\nThe only attacks you need to be ready for at all times are her Waterfowl Dance and Grab, which we covered how to counter in the segment above!\n\nIn phase two, you must utilize patience and should only attack when you have an opening.\n\nWe recommend baiting out her Scarlet Aeonia attack, running from it, and launching the Blood Blade Ashes of War at her.\n\nIf you don't have this as an option, we urge you to wait until she lands before attempting to damage her.\n\nYou can circle her and get one or two hits in, but you must immediately go on the defensive.\n\nDon't get reckless here.\n\nJust let her carry out her attacks, jump in for a couple of hits, runaway, and repeat until you have her defeated!\n\nIn some ways, phase one of Malenia may be more challenging to deal with for ranged users than the second phase, and that's due to ranged players having almost no time to breath or create distance.\n\nEven with the recent nerf, we strongly recommend using the Mimic Tear Ashes as a distraction, allowing you to cast uncontested spells on her from time to time.\n\nThe only attack you must watch out for is her Waterfowl Dance.\n\nFor this, we suggest distancing yourself from her the moment you see her leave the ground.\n\nAs long as you can avoid this attack, the first phase will break no sweat.\n\nWe recommend saving up some FP Flasks or Starlight Shards for phase two to restore your FP.\n\nYou will need a lot of it.\n\nEssentially, the strategy here is only to attack Malenia during her recovery period after she does her Scarlet Aeonia attack.",

        "Malenia also meets the Blind Swordsman during this time, who teaches her his Flowing Water swordplay technique that she\u2019s so famous for.\n\nMalenia lived with Miquella in the Haligtree (located northeast on the map of the Lands Between), hidden away from the influence of the Golden Order.\n\nAt some point, Malenia traveled south with her knights towards Caelid , but exactly why she did this is unknown.\n\nShe might have needed Radhan\u2019s Great Rune , or perhaps she or Miquella needed the stars to start moving again , but regardless of the reason, she and Radhan had a glorious battle.\n\nMalenia was about to lose, but in a last act of desperation, she breaks the needle within her and explodes in a Scarlet Bloom.\n\nThis is how the Scarlet Rot got into Caelid , corrupting the land, its leader, and many of its denizens.\n\nRadhan\u2019s forces still fight against the Rot , using tanks and firebombs to burn away the infection as best as they can, but it is a losing battle.\n\nMalenia manages to return to the Hailigtree , but her mere presence there spreads the Scarlet Rot through the realm , infecting the tree and making the iconic mushrooms and flowers grow everywhere.\n\nShe remains at the root of the now dead tree , waiting for the return of her dear Miquella.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear if Miquella was already missing when Malenia left for Caelid, or if he disappeared during her travels.\n\nThis is where players can find Malenia, the never-defeated Blade of Miquella , but if you succeed in taking her down, she blooms like she did against Radhan.\n\nThis form is called the Goddess of Rot , making Malenia the unwilling avatar of the Outer God in the Lands Between, and since that deity is all about decay and rebirth, it might not be the last time we see Malenia.\n\nThere are five NPCs you can encounter that heavily resemble Malenia , both in their relationship with Rot and the loss of limbs.\n\nThey are Millicent, Polyanna, Maureen, Amy, and Mary \u2014 although you can only interact with Millicent .\n\nThey seem to be descendants of Malenia, but she isn\u2019t known for having any kind of offspring or lineage.\n\nIn reality, they were likely born from Rot , sprouting from the Rot flowers and, as it seems, they are meant to be the Valkyries (or Angels) that will ascend with Malenia once she reaches godhood.\n\nIf the five sisters came from flowers, then they came out of them already fully grown.\n\nWe can follow the story of Millicent , found within the rotten lands of Caelid.\n\nWe are guided by a mysterious NPC called Gowry , who wants us to find a needle and fix it, so the Rot in Millicent can be kept at bay, allowing her to embark on a journey towards the Haligtree.\n\nGowry is one of the Pests , and he wishes us to help Millicent reach the Haligtree and earn her trust, only to kill her once we make it there.\n\nThis is because, if Millicent dies due to a betrayal, her rebirth will be as grand as it can ever be, at least according to Gowry himself.\n\nYet even if you decide to never betray Millicent, she dies either way , since she takes the needle keeping the Rot at bay.\n\nShe decides to die as she is , letting the rot take her and accepting her fate, never to be reborn again and escaping her fate as a Valkyrie of the Rot.\n\nA key item in all of this is the broken needle made of unalloyed gold , found in Caelid thanks to Gowry\u2019s guidance.\n\nThis needle seems to be the same one Malenia broke during her fight with Radhan , so once fixed, it is understandable that it can keep the Rot at bay , since it was made by the capable hands of Miquella.\n\nYet the needle is only a temporary measure , and the longer someone keeps it in, the more the Rot builds up inside of them.\n\nThis is why the Scarlet Aeonia cast by Malenia against Radhan was so mighty; it had been building up for decades , if not hundreds of years.\n\nFrom Rykard's greed to Ranni's doll, who is the strongest Empyrean of them all?"
