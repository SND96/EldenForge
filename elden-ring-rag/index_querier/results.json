        "Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is amongst the most popular characters in Elden Ring , and it's easy to see why.\n\nHer lore and backstory are phenomenal, her arena is stunning, and even the region she resides in is filled with constant awe-striking moments.\n\nFurthermore, the boss encounter is incredibly challenging but fair, epic, and gorgeous.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: How To Defeat Maliketh, The Black Blade While it's an optional boss fight on all counts, that won't stop most people from going through the trouble to reach her.\n\nEverything about this encounter is exhilarating, but it's understandable to see many people struggle to best her.\n\nAfter all, this is one of the most demanding fights in the entire game, and we wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nMalenia, Blade of Miquella Overview Location Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree Optional Yes Summons Players and Spirit Ashes Drops  Weak\n\nTo  Malenia, Blade of Miquella, resides deep within Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree.\n\nHowever, to get here, you must first reach Miquella's Haligtree, which can take quite some time in its own right.\n\nWhile this encounter is optional, it may be worth your time to seek it out as its one of the more unique battles in the entire game.\n\nAdditionally, the whole area is brimming with excellent items and gear but has callous enemies, so come prepared.\n\nWe recommend trying to tackle Malenia towards to end of the game when you are around Levels 90-100.\n\nShe's pretty challenging to take down.\n\nIf you are successful in besting Malenia in combat, you will earn 480,000 Runes and the Remembrance of the Rot Goddess, which you can exchange for cool rewards with Enia at the Roundtable Hold.\n\nIn addition to that, you will also receive Malenia's Great Rune, which you can activate by taking it to the Isolated Divine Tower.\n\nYou can reach the Isolated Divine Tower via a teleporter on the Divine Bridge or the Tower of Ruin's teleportation chest.\n\nThe thing with Malenia is she actually doesn't possess all that many attacks, but the attacks she does have are crazy good, well mastered, and are daunting to deal with.\n\nThink of her as the final boss in a fighting game.\n\nShe's not meant to have a ton of abilities, just a handful of excellent ones that will light you up if you make the slightest miscalculation or get a bit too careless.\n\nThere are two phases in this battle, and both of them are excruciatingly difficult.\n\nAlthough, the second phase may be a tad more challenging as she can one-shot practically anyone, even those who centered their build around having a large health pool and heavy armor.\n\nShe hits hard and is incredibly agile.\n\nOne wrong move will end you, but it isn't impossible or unfair.\n\nJust take everything one step at a time, and you will prevail.\n\nPhase 1 Waterfowl Dance Malenia leaps into the air then dives at her target.\n\nShe then eloquently twirls around while performing a series of slashes with her blade.\n\nFollowing that, she will let out two more slashes with a dash between each one, then ends it with another spinning AoE attack.\n\nThis attack has multiple hits, with each hit ultimately leading to her target's end.\n\nCounter: Run away from Malenia and keep running to create great distance between you two.\n\nIf you can wield a shield that has an excellent guard boost, you can use it to absorb most of her strikes.\n\nIf all else fails, try rolling towards her if she catches her, this will allow you to have a chance of surviving her onslaught of slashes.\n\nRolling backward or sideways will likely get you caught up in her fury, so we recommend avoiding that at all costs.\n\nKick Combos Most of Malenia's attack prowess comes from just this one move.\n\nMalenia's sweeping kick attack will get swiftly followed up with five possible moves, all of which are devastating to get caught by.\n\nWe will break each of them down below!\n\nCounter: Malenia's kick is easily telegraphed and can be avoided quite effortlessly if you're looking out for it.",
        "Welcome to our Elden Ring lore page for Malenia, who you or may not have heard is the Blade of Miquella.\n\nAside from being arguably the hardest boss in Souls history, Malenia also has one of the most interesting backstorys.\n\nBorn to Marika and Radagon alongside her twin borther Miquella, Malenia had it rough from the start.\n\nAs an Empyrean, she had the ability to one day ascend to true godhood, but she was also possessed of the horrifying Scarlet Rot, which causes her body to decay and her limbs to die.\n\nThis was because Marika and Radagon are one and the same, and having a single parent causes curses.\n\nDespite her suffering, Malenia perservered and fought to become strong, eventually meeting a blind swordsman who would teach her how to become a mighty warrior, and use her swordplay to help abate the constant Scarlet Rot.\n\nShe was so mighty, in fact, that the Cleanrot Knights would take up arms alongside her, even though they would eventually fall to decay themselves for doing so.\n\nShe eventually helped subdue the rot and overcome her physical ailments with a mix of prostheses and a special gold needle created by Miquella to help ward away the Outer Gods, of which the God of Rot is one.\n\nThings began to change drastically when the Elden Ring was shattered though.\n\nWith all of the demigods fighting for supremacy, Malenia and her army went south from the Haligtree to Caelid, briefly stopping to overwhelm Godrick along the way.\n\nAs Radahn and Malenia clashed, and as the last two demigods capable of fighting at the time, it became clear that they were simply too evenly matched.\n\nPerhaps out of desperation, perhaps out of frustration, Malenia relied on her Scarlet Rot to bloom during the fight, causing Caelid to turn into a wasteland and leading to the hollowing of Radahn.\n\nCollapsing after the fight, she was carried back to the Haligtree by a faithful Cleanrot Knight named Finlay, and sat there to await her brother's rebirth.\n\nHowever, during her absence, Miquella and his cocoon had been stolen by Mohg, and so Malenia continued to sleep, unaware of what had transpired.\n\nDuring the fight with the Tarnished, Malenia suffers her first true defeat, and is reborn as an avatar of the Rot itself, becoming a goddess of sorts.\n\nDespite this, she is still defeated by the Tarnished, and so ends her story.",
        "From the modder who brought us the legendary Malenia versus Starscourge Radahn comes the next bout in our Elden Ring heavyweight series, Malenia, Blade of Miquella versus Maliketh, the Black Blade.\n\nWhich of these late-game swordmasters will come out on top?\n\nBosses in FromSoftware games are formidable opponents.\n\nThey wreak havoc on playthroughs, speedruns, no damage runs, and often lead to broken controllers.\n\nSo, it's only natural for us to want to sit back and watch them wail on each other instead of us from time to time.\n\nRELATED:\n\nElden Ring And Euphoria Tell The Same Story Malenia versus Radhan was quite the spectacle, but the queen of rot managed to come out on top.\n\nIt's important to note that this isn't the same Radhan she previously fought, as he's now lost most of himself to the disease she inflicted upon Caelid.\n\nMalenia versus Maliketh is an interesting lineup, as she has the power to steal a foe's health, and he has the ability to consistently drain someone's life force.\n\nIt's really a battle of speed to see if Malenia can steal back enough of her health to offset Maliketh's debuff.\n\nAt the start of the first round you'll notice the size difference between the two bosses, with Maliketh towering over Malenia.\n\nThis can work in her favour though, as his large hitbox means her attacks don't have to be quite as accurate.\n\nMaliketh immediately seems to get the upper hand as his devastating attacks and debilitating damage over time effects quickly eat through Malenia's health bar.\n\nShe may feel quick when you fight her yourself, but against Maliketh she seems to move at a snail's pace.\n\nThe beast clergyman is able to land several vicious attacks in a row before she gets the chance to respond.\n\nHer hit points seem to almost completely disappear a few times but she manages to cling on with her lifesteal ability, chipping away at Maliketh as she gets some much-needed dodges in.\n\nShe transforms into the Goddess of Rot to even the odds, but even so, the first round is close.\n\nWatch the video above to see the full fight and all rounds for yourself.\n\nNext: What Does Your Apex Legends Inventory Say About You?",

        "In the entirety of Elden Ring , no name strikes as much fear into the hearts of players as Malenia the Blade of Miquella.\n\nOften referred to as the hardest boss in the game , the mere thought of fighting this red-headed swordswoman is enough to make even the most hardcore of gamers tremble.\n\nYes, Malenia is truly a terrifying opponent, but only in her home universe of Elden Ring.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: Who Won The Fight Between Radahn And Malenia?\n\nWhile Elden Ring is host to a wide variety of unique and powerful beings , the power-scaling for this universe is severely different compared to other gaming universes.\n\nWhere a boss from Elden Ring may look like an unbeatable opponent in their game, they could be seen as little more than an angry kitten in another.\n\nHere are a few characters from other games that do just that to Malenia.\n\nOne of Malenia's biggest strengths is her speed.\n\nIn her first phase, she overwhelms her enemies with a barrage of blade flourishes all while nimbly dodging whatever attacks you throw at her.\n\nEven in her second phase, her attacks are incredibly difficult to dodge, especially when avoiding the pools of Scarlet Rot she leaves everywhere.\n\nHowever, there's one being who wouldn't be affected by Malenia's speed at all.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog is speed personified.\n\nTo him, Malenia's would be moving at a snail's pace.\n\nHe could easily avoid her all while striking with his own attacks against the Blade of Miquella.\n\nThis isn't even considering his Super Sonic form where he can move faster than light.\n\nThis may seem like an odd choice considering Sans' frailty, but the funny skeleton and Malenia share many similarities.\n\nBoth rely on quick and nearly unavoidable attacks to overwhelm their opponent all while swiftly avoiding attacks themselves.\n\nHowever, the thing that gives Sans an edge in this fight is his versatility.\n\nRelated:\n\nUndertale: Things You Didn't Know About Sans While Malenia relies on her sword, Sans has an entire arsenal of abilities to aid him in combat.\n\nFrom the various bones he can summon from anywhere to his Gaster Blasters, the sheer variety of attacks that Sans is capable of unleashing would be more than enough to overcome Malenia.\n\nOn the off chance that it's not enough, he always has his 'Special Attack'.\n\nYou wouldn't expect a shovel to be a viable weapon against legions of monsters and knights, but Shovel Knight has proven this belief to be invalid.\n\nOn his quest to rescue Shield Knight, Shovel Knight has faced countless enemies with far more diversity and attacks than Malenia.\n\nThrough his travels, he has honed his skills with the shovel and gained numerous items that would make him more than a match for Malenia.\n\nHe can use the War Horn to block Malenia's incoming charges.\n\nHe could deal significant damage from a range with his Chaos Sphere.\n\nHe can even avoid all her attacks with the Phase Locket.\n\nWith all of his abilities, coupled with his shovel, there would be nothing Malenia could do.\n\nThere are very few that can stand up to the One Winged Angel.\n\nCloud Strife is one of them and so is Sora, ironically enough.\n\nHowever, Malenia is definitely not one of the people who could contend with Final Fantasy's most infamous character.\n\nIn a duel of pure swordsmanship, the battle would be fairly close as both are formidable warriors, but Sephiroth is far more than a simple swordsman.\n\nSephiroth has access to world-breaking magic, elemental manipulation, and even a godly transformation that can reduce his enemies fighting capabilities and curse them to die in a given time.\n\nIf these two were to fight, it wouldn't even be close.\n\nThey say the most unsuspecting enemy is the deadliest.\n\nWell, there's nothing more unsuspecting than a teenager wielding an oversized key.\n\nTime and time again, Sora has proven why the keyblade is one of the most feared weapons of his world and why he's one of the strongest keyblade wielders.",
        "Elden Ring has a lot of tough boss fights, but one of the hardest is Malenia, Blade of Miquella.\n\nShe's featured in the opening cut scene of Elden Ring and is also part of the Collector's Edition there's both a statue and a replica of Malenia's helmet.\n\nShe's pretty much as close as Elden Ring gets to a mascot, and as such, she's a powerful symbol of the game's difficulty.\n\nMalenia features a lot of long, sweeping sword attacks that are also lightning-fast and cover a lot of ground.\n\nHer Waterfowl Dance attack, in particular, can close any gap quickly and leave very little room to dodge.\n\nProper timing and sufficient stamina is essential for surviving this attack, or just being far enough away that she can't quite reach.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: Where To Find All Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones Or you can do what Reddit user toxicBird7 and just throw a freezing pot at her whenever she performs the wind-up animation for her attack.\n\nUser toxicBird7 posted a video to the Elden Ring subreddit (via GamesRadar ) showcasing the ease by which you can interrupt Malenia's most powerful attack just by tossing a pot at her face.\n\nJust throw it whenever she leaps into the air in preparation for her Waterfowl Dance move and she'll be stunned right out of it.\n\nThe hardest part of this strategy is just gathering the materials to make freezing pots.\n\nFirst, you need Glintstone Craftsman's Cookbook 6 for the recipe, and then you need both ritual pots and rimed crystal buds to craft freezing pots.\n\nGetting rimed crystal buds will require you travel southwest of the Inner Consecrated Snowfield grace location and then run around the base of the frozen pillars.\n\nOnce you have a few pots, you're ready for Malenia, but a word of caution.\n\nAll bosses have escalating status resistance, so you'll only be able to throw two freezing pots at Malenia before she develops a tolerance to them.\n\nAfter that, it'll require two pots for the same effect.\n\nSadly, two pots require far better timing than just the one, and you might be better off just learning the specific dodge timing.\n\nWe\u2019ve got plenty of other tips to help you get through the Lands Between, so check out our Elden Ring guide here .\n\nNext: There's No Better Video Game Protagonist Than Ben From Full Throttle",
        "Malenia is already one of FromSoftware's most infamous bosses, so much so that a summon went viral for beating her over and over for other players, but initially, they were much harder.\n\nCount your blessings that she got patched out before launch.\n\nDataminer kotn3l found a pre-patch 1.0 build where Malenia had another version of her signature move, more aggressive attacks, and better blocking, making her an even more gruelling opponent (thanks, PC Gamer ).\n\nIn the launch build, she has an incredibly difficult-to-dodge flurry attack that can instantly kill even the strongest Tarnished , vampiric draining abilities, two health bars, and more.\n\nShe might've been flat-out impossible in the unreleased build.\n\nRELATED: I Can't Believe We Haven't Had A Bloodborne Remaster\n\nYet In the original build, Malenia could use her flurry attack the second you initiate the fight, whereas post-1.0, you have to take her down to 80 percent health.\n\nAnd it gets worse.\n\nShe has two flurry attacks in the unreleased build and each uses its own cooldown meaning she could chain them back-to-back while better blocking your own attacks, doling out serious damage while taking little.\n\nHer ultimate ability, the aforementioned flurry attack, was originally called Malenia's Blade, tied to her sword's description.\n\nHowever, it had less reach and fewer pauses, meaning that it might have been a touch easier.\n\nAs dataminer kotn3l speculates, this attack was likely repurposed into the Waterfowl Dance.\n\nMalenia is infamous for her first phase alone , but things ramp up in the second when you're already low on healing supplies and willpower.\n\nIn the original, her Boom Explosion attack was slower, with her using the Aeonia attack much more.\n\nShe also lacked death dialogue making her fall silently when defeated which is hardly the triumphant victory that we earned on launch.\n\nNext time you're dredging through Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree, pushing toward that treacherous fight, just remember how much harder it could have been.\n\nWho knows?\n\nMaybe that's the motivation you need to slam a hammer or two into her skull for a quick victory.\n\nOr maybe you'll luck out and find Let Me Solo Her doddering about.\n\nNext: I'm Scared To Go Back To Elden Ring",
        "The Demigods are featured heavily in the story of Elden Ring .\n\nTwo of the most notable Demigods are Starscourge Radahn and Malenia, Blade of Miquella who are responsible for the hellscape that is Caelid.\n\nBoth are featured prominently in the opening cutscenes of the game and in the cutscene before the Radahn boss fight.\n\nHowever, you may have lost track of Malenia after this moment.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: What Is Glintstone?\n\nThis is because Malenia is not a required boss to beat the game.\n\nShe is hidden away in a very remote corner of Miquella's Haligtree, and many players will pass her by without even knowing.\n\nPlayers who do manage to find her though will be in for the fight of their lives.\n\nMalenia is widely regarded as being the hardest boss in Soulsborne history .\n\nShe is truly deserving of the quote, \"I have never known defeat.\"\n\nThe most important thing to know before we dive into the deep lore of Malenia, is exactly who she is.\n\nMalenia is the daughter of Radagon and Marika .\n\nShe is also the twin brother of Miquella.\n\nAs such, they formed an inseparable bond, and their two stories intertwine closely.\n\nSince Miquella always remains in the body of a child, Malenia swore to be his undefeated bodyguard, in order to keep her brother safe.\n\nIt seems that early in her life Malenia was afflicted with the Scarlet Rot .\n\nHer condition is not typical of other victims of the disease, however.\n\nIt seems that either shortly after she was born, or perhaps before she was born, the Outer God of Scarlet Rot was sealed within her physical body .\n\nWe do not know whether Radagon did this or if the Outer God itself was responsible.\n\nWhat we do know is that for all her power, Malenia's body could not withstand the Rot, and slowly decayed over time.\n\nMalenia's Scarlet Flower blooms in times of extreme stress.\n\nThis blooming of the flower grants her unimaginable power, but also significantly increases the levels of Rot within her body.\n\nAt the close of our battle with Malenia, we can get the Scarlet Aeonia Incantation from her remembrance.\n\nIt reads: \" Each time the scarlet flower blooms, Malenia's rot advances.\n\nIt has bloomed twice already.\n\nWith the third bloom, she will become a true goddess\".\n\nThere is some debate as to how many times she has bloomed when we fight her, so let's look into it.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that Malenia bloomed for the third time during our fight and ascended to godhood right there in the boss room.\n\nFirst, and most obvious is that her name changes in phase two to Malenia, Goddess of Rot.\n\nHer remembrance is also from \"The Rot Goddess\" not \"Malenia\".\n\nThe problem with this theory is we don't have much evidence for the first bloom.\n\nWe know she bloomed in our fight and during her fight against Radahn.\n\nThat's two accounted for, but what of the third?\n\nMany players will point to the giant Scarlet Flower found outside the elevator to Malenia's boss fight.\n\nMany think that the armor set here was hers before she was given the prosthetics by Miquella.\n\nThe logic for this theory is that Miquella tried to use an imperfect Gold Needle, and it forced her to bloom for the first time in that room, hence why it is unaccounted for since only Miquella and Malenia were there.\n\nRelated:\n\nElden Ring: Who Is Blaidd?\n\nHowever, there is equal evidence that our fight with Malenia was only her second bloom, and she may not be truly dead.\n\nSince we have no record of Malenia's first bloom, some players reject this idea.\n\nPeople who subscribe to this theory will attribute the bloom outside of Malenia's room to one of Millicent's sisters .\n\nThe theory does have some credibility, because, upon defeating Malenia, we receive no after-battle message.\n\nNo \"Enemy Slain,\" or \"Great Enemy Slain,\" and most importantly, no \"God Slain\" as we see with the Elden Beast.\n\nIt is very unlike From Software to miss a detail like this, causing some to speculate that Malenia still has to bloom once more.",
        "Malenia is the toughest boss to beat in all of Elden Ring .\n\nI don't think that's a statement many would argue with.\n\nThank goodness beating her isn't mandatory if you want to finish the game.\n\nMany of you have opted to battle Malenia though, and some of you have become so adept at knowing what she can do, and more importantly what can damage her most, that one of you has managed to beat the most intimidating boss in all of The Lands Between in just ten seconds.\n\nThat's right, that Elden Ring boss you spent hours throwing yourself against to no avail, and maybe even bailing on altogether, can be beaten in ten seconds with the right tools at your disposal.\n\nJdyhrberg posted evidence of their quick battle against Malenia on the Elden Ring subreddit.\n\nAs if doing so to make absolutely everyone else who has ever faced Malenia feel inferior wasn't bad enough, the clip appears to be a direct response to someone beating the boss in 17 seconds just days earlier.\n\nRELATED:\n\nTears Of The Kingdom Is Giving Me Flashbacks To The Best\n\nAnd Worst Of Elden Ring Actually, there's no appears about it.\n\nJdyhrberg wrote right there in the caption that they had seen the 17-second boss fight and raised them a ten second one.\n\nThe Elden Ring pro throws themselves right at Malenia, triggering the mid-match cutscene after just five seconds.\n\nOnce the cutscene has been skipped, they proceed to throw a freezing pot at the Blade of Miquella before running at her again, bringing the battle to an end in a little over ten seconds.\n\nThe impressive feat has naturally generated a lot of discussion in the replies.\n\nJdyhrberg admits they basically used the same build as RS_LionHeart , the player who beat Malenia in 17 seconds right before this ten second achievement.\n\nHowever, they changed up their weapon of choice and tweaked their stats a little to make the fight go by seven seconds faster.\n\nThe blade you can see depleting Malenia's health at an alarming rate is the Beastman's Curved Sword.\n\nYou know, just in case you want to try and better jdhyrberg by beating the boss in nine seconds.\n\nThe lengths Elden Ring players will go to in order to get more out of this game while we wait for the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is remarkable.\n\nNot just finding builds that will beat the game's toughest boss in ten seconds, but also the wide array of different methods people have employed to play the game.\n\nOne streamer beat two copies at the same time, one of which was played on a dance mat , while last week another streamer finished their four-month playthrough during which they controlled their Tarnished using nothing more than mind power .\n\nNEXT:\n\nCritical Role's Queen By Midnight Fills A Major Board Game Void"
