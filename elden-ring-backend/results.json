        "One of Midra\u2019s more strange combos is when he raises his sword up high, in front of his face, then does a sweeping swing.\n\nHe follows this with a burst of frenzy flames, then another slow, heavy swing in front of him.\n\nIt can be easy to confuse this with the other three hit combo, but the good news is usually the mixup will only result in you getting hit by the madness burst which does relatively low damage.\n\nJust make sure you adjust your gameplan to avoid the third swing.  \n\nWhen Midra raises his sword horizontally in front of his face, he is about to do a quick two hit combo, then follow it up with a long range dash attack that leaves a trail of flames behind him.  \n\nMake sure you roll away from the trail of flames, or else you can take damage from the as they fizzle out.  \n\nFrom a distance Midra has a few different gap closing moves.\n\nFirst up is a simple long range thrust, telegraphed by him raising his sword up pointed forward.\n\nRoll into the thrust to avoid it.  \n\nFor the other, Midra lights off the ground and floats in the air momentarily, before flying toward you with a wide sweeping slash.\n\nThis is another roll toward, then attack from behind.  \n\nAnother flying attack is Midra\u2019s spinning combo.\n\nHe will do a slow twirl, holding his sword out, before quickly unleashing two spinning slashes.\n\nHe then stops momentarily, before doing another three spins.\n\nThe timing on this one is a little odd, but generally you just want to roll toward Midra two times as the spins begin, trying to end up behind him.  \n\nOne of Midra\u2019s most damaging moves is his jumping stab.\n\nAfter leaping into the air, Midra does a powerful downward thrust.\n\nIf you are caught by this stab you get brutally skewered by his spiny sword (cool to see at least once), taking massive damage.\n\nAs with most of these command grab-esque super attacks, if you dodge into it just before impact you can avoid the damage and get a couple of attacks in while Midra is standing back up.\n\nMidra will also mix in various frenzied flame spells.\n\nThere are two versions of this: Midra leans his head forward, unleashing a single burst of frenzy flames.\n\nWhen Midra spreads his arms, he is doing the long range version that covers the entire area in front of him, same as the one from the start of the battle.\n\nBoth versions are avoided by rolling into the burst as it comes out, but the quick one can be hard to see coming.  \n\nAt about 60% health Midra will enter phase two with a new attack.\n\nHe hits a t-pose and slowly floats into the air, his head becoming increasingly fiery.\n\nHe then dives into the ground, creating a massive explosion.\n\nAs soon as you see him start floating you want to run as far away as possible.\n\nOnce the explosion happens, you can run back in and do a jump attack combo as Midra slowly stands back up (this only applies to the first time Midra uses this attack.\n\nSubsequent uses he seems to stand up much faster).  \n\nFrom this point forward many of Midra\u2019s sword attacks are augmented with flame, meaning some of his basic attacks build towards Madness.\n\nHe also has a bunch of new attacks that revolve around Madness flames.  \n\nSome of his attacks from phase one also have new extensions.\n\nFor example, his thrust now has a follow up where his sword bursts open, creating a second, wider hitbox.\n\nAnother is his powerful leaping stab, which now has a spiky burst around it if he misses the initial stab.\n\nThis means you will want to dodge away from the initial stab, wait for the burst, then follow up with a jumping attack.  \n\nWhen Midra points his sword outward and it becomes wrapped in flame he is about to unleash a ground targeted flame attack.\n\nHe will slash, and a wave of flames shoot out across the ground in a cone shape.\n\nThankfully this is pretty easy to avoid, you can simply roll into the wave of flames as they do not linger long enough to deal damage afterwards.",

        "Not only is Radahn extremely difficult, but you have to fight him in his prime alongside Miquella.\n\nAfter defeating him, you can trade his remembrance for two greatswords Radahn wielded in his youth, as well as the Light of Miquella, the best incantation in Shadow of the Erdtree.\n\nMessmer the Impaler is the boss that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree heavily marketed, and as such, most players expected a mechanically flawless boss fight with just the right amount of goosebumps, and we got exactly that.\n\nBy defeating him, you can either get the spear he wields, which has one of the coolest looking unique weapon skills in the game, and an incantation that requires a strong faith build to use effectively.\n\nAfter defeating Messmer, you can progress further into the DLC.\n\nUsing his spear can turn the direction subsequent boss fights can go.\n\nWhat starts off as a fakeout boss transforms into one of the creepiest FromSoftware bosses to date, and of course, it\u2019s a Frenzied Flame-themed boss fight.\n\nMidra was a failed Lord of Frenzied Flame, and now he stays at his manse, awaiting his defeat by your hands.\n\nHave some faith, even in the Land of Shadow.\n\nBeating him is a feat on its own, but you get to use his amazingly versatile greatsword alongside one of the best incantations in the game.\n\nMidra\u2019s Flame of Frenzy incantation can be molded into an excellent faith build if you have the patience to properly test it out.\n\nMetyr, The Mother of Fingers is a secret DLC boss that you can only fight if you progress Count Ymir\u2019s quest line and blow the finger bells scattered across the Land of Shadow.\n\nThe fight isn\u2019t as difficult as other DLC bosses, but it\u2019s certainly very disturbing just looking at this abomination.\n\nDefeating Metyr can give you one of the best stalves in Elden Ring, which is capable of using both incantations as well as sorceries , giving you more variety and choice.\n\nThe second weapon is the Gazing Finger, which is a slightly above-average colossal weapon with a great skill.\n\nOne of the first two remembrance bosses most players will run into, Rellana is Renalla\u2019s sister who left the Lands Between and renounced her birthright to find Messmer in the Land of Shadow, becoming his sworn blade in the process.\n\nRellana is one of the most fun boss fights in the DLC and defeating her gives you an equally fun remembrance weapon.\n\nHer twin blades have two different casts that can be incredibly useful in PvE. You can also get the Twin Moons sorcery, which is also equally overpowered, making Rellana\u2019s remembrance weapons some of the best in the game.\n\nElden Ring's Ashes of War gives powers and abilities, some of which are devastating... or just really cool.",

        "Just across the road from the Southern Messmer Camp is the large Moorth Ruins, which is partially buried by a crater.\n\nHere you can find one of Miquella's Crosses, alongside a silent but friendly monk named Dryleaf Dane.\n\nAt the base of the cross on the northern side of the ruins, you can find the Scadutree Fragment.\n\nFor more on Scadutree Fragments, check out our Shadow of the Erdtree Scadutree Fragment Locations Guide."
