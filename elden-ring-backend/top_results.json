        "Midra, Lord of Frenzied Flame is an optional Boss found in the Abyssal Woods region of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC.\n\nHe is the final boss of the Midra's Manse Minor Dungeon.\n\nCheck out our boss strategy below to learn how to beat this great foe: How to Reach Midra's Manse  First off, make sure you have the Map: Abyss, found in the Abyssal Woods.\n\nYou can reach this map fragment using our walkthrough here .  \n\nAlso be sure to grab the two Scadutree Fragments from inside the church next to the map stele!\n\nAbandoned Church Scadutree Fragment From the Map Stele, we need to make our way all the way across the Abyssal Woods to the southwest corner where the Manse is located.  \n\nYou will have to run past a couple of Winter Lanterns along the way.\n\nThese enemies chase you relentlessly if they spot you, and kill you instantly if they grab you.  \n\nYou can choose to just run past them, or you can actually kill them if you parry their grab using a shield with Carian Retaliation.\n\nThe timing is hard, but you need to hit the parry after the Lantern lifts its wand in the air and as it reaches out toward you.  \n\nKeep running west, through the fog and into this wooded corner of the map.\n\nYou will see the manse in the distance.\n\nYou will need to complete the short dungeon to reach Midra at the end.\n\nMidra, Lord of Frenzied Flame Boss Fight Strategy Guide  Recommended Scadutree Blessing 10 - 12 Before the battle starts, you have to kill Midra in his wretch form.\n\nHe can actually deal somewhat significant damage with his grab and swiping attacks, so try to just lay into him with a bunch of quick attacks and kill him before he can retaliate.\n\nThere is a small opening after he dies to heal or buff yourself before the true form begins.\n\nMidra, Lord of Frenzied Flame is a humanoid enemy wielding a large two hand sword and a variety of madness inducing magic.\n\nHis attacks deal both physical and holy damage, so if you are using a shield expect to take some chip damage depending on the damage negation.  \n\nMany of Midra\u2019s attacks also inflict Madness.\n\nIf Madness is triggered you are likely to die instantly due to the long period of vulnerability afterwards.\n\nEquipping gear with high Focus, like the Clarifying Horn Charm, will help reduce build up.  \n\nMidra is an offensive powerhouse, but is susceptible to some of our favorite effects: Bleed and Stagger.\n\nWith the Axe Talisman and a heavy weapon, Midra can be staggered in as few as 3-4 charge attacks, allowing you to keep him stunlocked for large portions of the battle.\n\nIf you react quickly you even have just enough time to drink one Flask before triggering the critical attack.\n\nConsider equipping the Stonebarbed and Spiked Cracktear to your Wondrous Physick for their charge attack boosting properties.  \n\nMidra will always open the battle with the same attack, two bursts of Frenzy flames from his \u201chead\u201d.\n\nWatch the center of the head closely, there is a flash of light right before the burst comes out, that is when you want to roll toward him.\n\nIf you move quickly you can actually run up and get behind Midra before the second burst happens, allowing you to get a full charge attack on him before the battle even begins.  \n\nMidra\u2019s most common melee attack is a three swing combo.\n\nHe raises his sword above and behind his head before swinging down.\n\nAfter a short delay, he follows it with two quicker swings.\n\nDodge roll toward him as each swing comes down, then after the final swing you can land an attack.  \n\nAnother is his oddly weak offhand stab.\n\nMidra raises the dagger in his offhand above his head, then stabs downward.\n\nThis move is quick, and deals pretty negligible damage.\n\nDodge roll toward Midra as the dagger comes down and you can get in a quick attack before he regains composure.\n\nKeep an eye out though, because he will occasionally follow one stab immediately with another.\n\nOne of Midra\u2019s more strange combos is when he raises his sword up high, in front of his face, then does a sweeping swing.",

        "One of Midra\u2019s more strange combos is when he raises his sword up high, in front of his face, then does a sweeping swing.\n\nHe follows this with a burst of frenzy flames, then another slow, heavy swing in front of him.\n\nIt can be easy to confuse this with the other three hit combo, but the good news is usually the mixup will only result in you getting hit by the madness burst which does relatively low damage.\n\nJust make sure you adjust your gameplan to avoid the third swing.  \n\nWhen Midra raises his sword horizontally in front of his face, he is about to do a quick two hit combo, then follow it up with a long range dash attack that leaves a trail of flames behind him.  \n\nMake sure you roll away from the trail of flames, or else you can take damage from the as they fizzle out.  \n\nFrom a distance Midra has a few different gap closing moves.\n\nFirst up is a simple long range thrust, telegraphed by him raising his sword up pointed forward.\n\nRoll into the thrust to avoid it.  \n\nFor the other, Midra lights off the ground and floats in the air momentarily, before flying toward you with a wide sweeping slash.\n\nThis is another roll toward, then attack from behind.  \n\nAnother flying attack is Midra\u2019s spinning combo.\n\nHe will do a slow twirl, holding his sword out, before quickly unleashing two spinning slashes.\n\nHe then stops momentarily, before doing another three spins.\n\nThe timing on this one is a little odd, but generally you just want to roll toward Midra two times as the spins begin, trying to end up behind him.  \n\nOne of Midra\u2019s most damaging moves is his jumping stab.\n\nAfter leaping into the air, Midra does a powerful downward thrust.\n\nIf you are caught by this stab you get brutally skewered by his spiny sword (cool to see at least once), taking massive damage.\n\nAs with most of these command grab-esque super attacks, if you dodge into it just before impact you can avoid the damage and get a couple of attacks in while Midra is standing back up.\n\nMidra will also mix in various frenzied flame spells.\n\nThere are two versions of this: Midra leans his head forward, unleashing a single burst of frenzy flames.\n\nWhen Midra spreads his arms, he is doing the long range version that covers the entire area in front of him, same as the one from the start of the battle.\n\nBoth versions are avoided by rolling into the burst as it comes out, but the quick one can be hard to see coming.  \n\nAt about 60% health Midra will enter phase two with a new attack.\n\nHe hits a t-pose and slowly floats into the air, his head becoming increasingly fiery.\n\nHe then dives into the ground, creating a massive explosion.\n\nAs soon as you see him start floating you want to run as far away as possible.\n\nOnce the explosion happens, you can run back in and do a jump attack combo as Midra slowly stands back up (this only applies to the first time Midra uses this attack.\n\nSubsequent uses he seems to stand up much faster).  \n\nFrom this point forward many of Midra\u2019s sword attacks are augmented with flame, meaning some of his basic attacks build towards Madness.\n\nHe also has a bunch of new attacks that revolve around Madness flames.  \n\nSome of his attacks from phase one also have new extensions.\n\nFor example, his thrust now has a follow up where his sword bursts open, creating a second, wider hitbox.\n\nAnother is his powerful leaping stab, which now has a spiky burst around it if he misses the initial stab.\n\nThis means you will want to dodge away from the initial stab, wait for the burst, then follow up with a jumping attack.  \n\nWhen Midra points his sword outward and it becomes wrapped in flame he is about to unleash a ground targeted flame attack.\n\nHe will slash, and a wave of flames shoot out across the ground in a cone shape.\n\nThankfully this is pretty easy to avoid, you can simply roll into the wave of flames as they do not linger long enough to deal damage afterwards."
